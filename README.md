- The app will create a detailed breakdown of your savings program, showing:  
  - Daily savings contributions.  
  - Cumulative savings totals.  
  - Milestone markers (e.g., halfway or completion).  
- You can view this report directly in the app or export it as a PDF or spreadsheet.  

### Step 3: Generate Calendar Events  
- After reviewing your savings plan, click the **Generate Calendar Events** button.  
- The app will create a `.ics` file, which contains all the events for your savings program (one for each day).  
- Download the `.ics` file and import it into your favorite calendar app (e.g., macOS Calendar, Google Calendar).  
- Each event will remind you of your daily savings contribution and keep you on track.
